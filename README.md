🐍 Snake Game Project
📌 Overview
This project is a classic Snake Game developed to demonstrate fundamental programming and game development concepts. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow longer, and avoids collisions with walls and itself. The game focuses on logic building, real-time updates, and user interaction.
🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to apply core programming skills such as loops, condition handling, collision detection, and event-driven input to create an interactive game.
